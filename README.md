# ⚔️ THE ARSENAL: VANSH JAIN'S STUDY HUB ⚔️

### "Oye! Study karni hai ya mazaak? CHAK DE PHATTE, MAXIMUM EFFORT!" 

Welcome to the **Arsenal Drop Zone**, a high-octane study command center built by **Mr. Vansh Jain**. This isn't just code; it's a full-on vibe. If your study material feels like a dry paratha, Vansh just added the butter, the spice, and a side of Deadpool attitude.

## 🎭 THE FOURTH WALL (Vansh's Tactical Briefing)
Look, Paji, we’ve all been there. Staring at 50-page PDFs while your brain screams for a break. So, Vansh decided to weaponize the boredom. He took a bunch of top-tier AI agents, gave them a Deadpool mask, and told them: *"Oye, make studying actually sexy."*

Whether you're prepping for exams or just trying to look smart, we’ve got your back. We slice your documents, quiz your brain, and celebrate your wins like a true Punjabi wedding—with balloons and maximum hype.

## 🛠️ THE TACTICAL TOOLBOX (Full Power Features)

### 📤 1. THE ARSENAL DROP ZONE
The main gate. Throw your PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files in. Our agents shred them faster than a bullet train. No leftovers, just pure intel.

### 📇 2. WEAPONIZED FLASHCARDS
Notes are for rookies. Flashcards are for legends. We generate Q&A pairs that actually make sense, with difficulty levels from "Easy Peasy" to "Maximum Effort."

### 🎯 3. MISSION INTEL QUIZZES
Wanna see if you're actually learning or just scrolling? Take the quiz. Score high and the red, black, and white balloons will swarm your screen. Score low... and well, don't tell Vansh.

### 📅 4. STRATEGIC BATTLE PLAN
Vansh knows you love a good plan. Our Planner Agent builds a day-by-day map of your mission. Track your progress, neutralize targets, and stay ahead of the game.

### 💬 5. THE INTERROGATION ROOM (CHAT)
Got a question? Ask. Our RAG-powered chat is grounded in *your* documents. No gaslighting, no hallucinations—just straight talk.
