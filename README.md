# ⚔️ THE ARSENAL: AI-POWERED MULTI-AGENT STUDY HUB ⚔️

### "Oye, Recruit! Engineered by Mr. Vansh Jain · Hack Infinity 2025 Finalist"

> *"With great power, comes great... wait, wrong franchise. WITH MAXIMUM EFFORT, COMES MAXIMUM GRADES!"* — Deadpool (probably while eating a paratha)

## 🎭 MISSION BRIEFING (Vansh's Tactical Overview)
Look, we all know studying usually feels like staring at a blank wall until your brain melts. **The Arsenal** was built to weaponize that boredom. This is a sophisticated **Multi-Agent RAG System** designed by **Mr. Vansh Jain** to transform dry PDFs into high-octane study tools.

*Message from Vansh:* "I wanted to build something that actually helps students without the snooze-fest. So, I strapped a Deadpool mask onto a fleet of AI agents and told them to slice through documents like a katana through butter."

## 🛠️ THE TACTICAL TECH STACK (The Hardware)
*   **LLM Orchestration:** LangChain with Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Surgical accuracy, zero fluff)
*   **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (Semantic memory that never forgets... unlike you after a weekend)
*   **Frontend:** Custom-styled Streamlit (Aggressive Comic-Book CSS architecture)
*   **Document Processing:** PyPDF2, python-docx, and OCR fallback (No document left behind)
*   **Architecture:** Multi-Agent Controller Pattern (The agents talk to each other so you don't have to)

## 🧑‍💻 THE AGENT SQUADRON (The Muscle)

### 📤 1. THE READER AGENT (Data Ingestion)
Performs surgical extraction of text from your "intel" (PDF, DOCX, TXT). It handles semantic chunking and topic classification. 
> *"It shreds your files faster than I shred bad guys. No leftovers, just pure actionable intel."*

### 📇 2. THE FLASHCARD AGENT (Active Recall)
Generates high-impact Q/A pairs with dynamic difficulty tagging. Supports export to Anki for when you actually decide to study.

### 🎯 3. THE QUIZ AGENT (Assessment)
Constructs adaptive quizzes that hit you where it hurts. It evaluates performance in real-time with explanations that actually make sense.

### 📅 4. THE PLANNER AGENT (Strategic Roadmap)
Analyzes extracted topics to build a day-by-day "Battle Plan." It prioritizes high-weightage sectors and tracks your "Mission Completion."

### 💬 5. THE CHAT AGENT (Contextual RAG)
A specialized interrogation module that answers questions strictly based on the documents. No hallucinations—just cold, hard facts.
